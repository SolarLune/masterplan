[x] Fix color picker not being able to be held outside of the color edit menu
[x] Things that modify cards (undo / redo, timer elapsing, find) activates that page
[x] Deleting a sub-page card invalidates that page so find doesn't find it; it should no longer be updated
Add (?) bubbles that you can hover over to get some text / information. This would probably best be done with a GUI element to 
[x] Unlock Aspect Ratio isn't working
[x] Make it so menus on the edges are anchored there, and won't move regardless of window resizing
[x] Fix pasting sub-page in itself, which prevents you from being able to get out???
[x] Fix Map card not showing after autoload on Windows (texture is refreshed before data is written, or something right after autoload?)
[x] Fix recent files filepath not being complete on Windows
[x] Card movement!
[ ] Time unit estimation should be better
  [ ] Fix time unit estimation to handle large months (i.e. many years) properly
[x] Window Transparency / make window transparent if mouse isn't in window
[ ] Ability to point to different cards (maybe this is a specific card type?)
  [ ] Ability to run commands / execute functions?
[ ] Key to jump to ends of arrow cards
[ ] Ability to search / list Cards by type
[ ] Ability to edit Card contents using buttons to cycle through the controls
[ ] Add method to copy colors from one card to others
[ ] Cards should be able to be raised or lowered to always be on top or below, etc.
[x] Fix crashes related to sub-pages
[x] Move screenshot location for sub-pages up
[x] Add shortcut to unlink Card from any connected Cards
[ ] Add tags or icon functionality to prioritize Cards; they can also be searchable in the Find dialog.
[ ] Add button / option to group Cards together, effectively locking them into a shape.
[ ] FIX: Saving while an expanded card is collapsed will save it as collapsed
[x] Resize Cards from left and top
[ ] PDF / PNG output (See: https://github.com/signintech/gopdf)
[ ] Find dialog should be able to search for types (either with a phrase, like ":image", or with a drop-down)
[ ] Moving cards with keyboard keys
[ ] Selecting them via Tab + Shift+Tab
[ ] Dragging objects, it's possible to misdrop them onto nearby cells instead of their exact, correct cell
[ ] Open different projects as tabs
[ ] Update text rendering; it's bad with light text, particularly
[ ] GUI scaling (so buttons can become bigger, as an example, for higher-resolution screens / people with visibility issues)
[x] Fix crashing if a theme lacks a color for a specific card type; it should instead log the problem and return an ugly color, so it's usable, but not just BAD
[ ] Fix text in keybindings section
[ ] Reimplement relative paths to resources (images, sounds) in save files.

[ ] Replace img usage with go, see if that allows for Mac M1 builds
[x] Focus on Timer should be disabled, I think? Zooming in seems to be annoying.
[ ] Focus on Timer should just switch to its page?
[ ] Don't number top-level numbering
[ ] Numbering options?
[ ] Search for keybindings by key name, not just shortcut name
[ ] Manual / documentation for v0.8
[ ] Copy shapes in maps
[x] Fix the text somehow, it still looks bad
[x] Implement searching shortcuts
[x] Replace double-click setting with drop-down for nothing, checkbox, last Card type: https://discord.com/channels/339550825154347008/758009278756946040/90482710  7102851164
[x] Fix inability to click nodes on top of other Cards
[x] Loading doesn't link properly: https://discord.com/channels/339550825154347008/900240962792620052/902289884541239306
[ ] Add Touch support: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_TouchFingerEvent
[ ] Press the link shortcut to link, rather than holding and clicking to link. This would allow you to put it on a mouse button for ease of link.
[ ] Transparent window background: Doesn't seem to be possible with SDL, unfortunately. I'll have to see if I can work around this, perhaps with a Shaped window or something???
[x] Re-implement saving the pan location so you can pick up where you left off
[ ] Connected sound (lines or neighboring) cards should play in sequence
[ ] The line underneath text COULD appear under each new empty line / after two empty lines?
[ ] Re-implement autosave
[ ] Re-implement help / manual (this might be better done via pages you can click through?)
[ ] Re-implement automatic backups
[x] Re-implement auto-load
[ ] Fix save overwrite not prompting if the filename is different from an existing file + ".plan", even though we add that later
[ ] Fix images not loading properly on project load
[x] Re-implement Recent Files list
[x] Re-implement Boards (this has been done by means of sub-boards)
[ ] Re-use palette menu across multiple Map Cards if possible
[ ] Make it so non-active Boards update rarely (maybe once every second, for example).
[ ] Add a manual to look through to see some techniques / information.
[ ] Optimize CPU execution
[ ] Optimize GPU execution
[ ] Text scaling (so text can be smaller for people who want it to be smaller to fit more onscreen???)
[ ] File filters aren't working on Mac? See: https://discord.com/channels/339550825154347008/900240962792620052/904398152386355210
[ ] Look into compiling for M1 Macs - could be possible to build into build_script with custom compilation flags: https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/issues/479#issuecomment-949781196
    That said, it's not working on M1 Macs currently because of possibly SDL_ttf - this means that it might work if we didn't rely on SDL_ttf...?
    See: https://discord.com/channels/339550825154347008/758009278756946040/906326736965357628
[ ] Kapersky detects MP as malware: https://discord.com/channels/339550825154347008/758009278756946040/904661968047198238
[ ] Edges on cards: https://discord.com/channels/339550825154347008/758009278756946040/904551737355026432
[ ] Re-implement URL parsing
[ ] MP4 video support?
[ ] Hovering over a website should open a little card linking to the website, with additional information (favicon, hostname (e.g. google.com), and description). See how Google Sheets does it.
[x] Re-add Paste Content command
[x] Re-implement pasting lists as a sequence of Cards in MasterPlan
[ ] Re-implement pasting Cards as a text list outside of MasterPlan
[x] Consume shortcut after saving
[x] Lines should be one color, no outline (not sure about either of these), have arrows pointing towards the other end, rather than the current sloppy implementation. They should draw before or after shadows (test it). They should draw on top of maps.
[ ] Edit Menu > Set Size, Align Cards for consistency
[ ] Alignment options for cards on the board (i.e. center, align vertically, spread, etc)
[ ] Alignment options for text in Cards (not quite sure how to do this yet)
[x] System notification when something happens (a timer elapsing, for example) in MasterPlan. See: https://github.com/gen2brain/beeep or https://github.com/0xAX/notificator
[x] Disable Grid setting
[x] Implement searching again
[x] Reimplement custom fonts.
[ ] Implement File Card type - this takes a link to a file on your computer or URL and opens it. Maybe this should be part of URL parsing?
[ ] Ability to press a Button to Jump to a Card
[ ] Ability to press a Button to Jump to a Project
[ ] Add a means to link to locations on your board (this might be better done after Boards have been re-implemented)

[ ] Rethink RenderTexture system - it'd be cool if it worked with reloading fonts (which means text can be different sizes, and the TextRenderer.RenderText() function would inform this; perhaps
    the RenderTexture system should return a RenderTexture if given something that implements an interface somehow? It needs more flexibility, I think, is what I'm saying.)

[x] Line for editable text goes underneath first line for title?
Number top-level tasks option
Save pan position
Fix map rotation icons
Fix checker pattern
Add size un-lock to grid option
Labels NEED To be able to scroll. There's not really a good way around this, it's highly necessary.
GUI cutting off in Input Options
Tie icons into themes

Tabbing around menus / boards
Buttons should close menus
Lock zoom / camera render position
See about fixing font up to be EVEN smoother
Trim whitespace before loading image pa>th
Images don't load if they contain special characters (Russian, for example?)
Downloading / loading images might not be multithreaded??? Seems like it pauses loading a project to have images in them.
Split shortcut - use this when editing textboxes to split a Note, Checkbox, etc. Card into two between the cursor.
Draw shadow underneath Map
Note card becoming too large crashes due to exceeding graphics card texture limits

- [ ] Execution of files somehow (either through evaluating text as a file link, or through a Card that accepts a path that will open it with the default application). It'd
  be nice if I could click for example on an executable to run it, or on a markdown file to open it in a markdown editor (if I have it set up like that on my computer).
- [ ] Calculator

[x] Space bar (or any keyboard key, or mouse click) to pan
[x] Drag and drop plan to load project
[ ] Reimplement Project.Modified / Confirmation before loading project
[ ] Fix being able to undo project loading
[ ] Map buttons can be hidden by Cards above
[x] Migrate the rest of program settings over
[x] Allow keybinding editing / saving and loading
[x] Fix double-clicking to select a word anymore?
[x] Need to be able to delete Drawables
[ ] Re-implement recent paths list / project autoloading / review main.go
[x] Filepath needs to be set when saving projects
[x] Saving seems to not save rects properly anymore?
[ ] Confirm when loading project
[ ] Close menu when loading project
[ ] Use Label.Property directly for Card Contents that manually sync the Label and Property (i.e. CheckboxContents / NoteContents / etc).
[x] Count-down Timer
[ ] Reimplement Timers doing things on connected things on completion

- A
- Progression Task
- Pasting Images
- Create a roadmap; post on itch and Steam.

- Double-clicking on different Card to background creates Card
- Project setting for importing images at their original size
- Add option to not create new Tasks when double-clicking
- Buttons for loading images, etc.
- Maps should have a border to differentiate between them

- [x] Drag and drop images
- [x] Map should be lower depth, if possible?

- Wheel scrolling should be more sensitive
- Two-finger slide to pan project?
- Different camera pan locations for different Pages; that way switching between them doesn't necessitate moving the camera all of the time.
- Export to One-Note / to image / PDF
- When loading projects from previous versions of MasterPlan, focus on all Cards after load; otherwise, the camera pan should be saved, too.
- Add "Quick Label" mode or something - something that would allow Labels to draw glyphs directly to the screen rather than to a texture first, which would be good for Labels that change often, like time indicators
- Detect when an error causes a crash within the first, say, second; if it happens then on restart, suggest that there could've been an issue and ask if the user wishes to load the settings.

Short-term:

- Different wording for options in context menu (Copy Cards -> Copy Card when only one is selected, Delete Cards > Delete 34 Cards when 34 are selected )
- Status bar?
- Messages when soemthing happens?
- When zoomed out, text shouldn't draw or should be simplified
- Card snapping
- Hover over stuff to get a hint

Can't click and drag on Checkboxes when it's just 1x1

Copy + Paste Cards as text?

Cycle through selected Cards with Ctrl + Scroll wheel or menu?

Instead of the current Board tab system, it would be better to implement a hierarchical view, allowing you to create and reposition folders and pages. Boards would now be Pages, allowing you to rearrange pages of information to be correlated, while also remaining easy to reach at a moment's notice.

RESOLVED

- FIX?: MasterPlan no longer crashes when typing End and Delete in a Textbox? Specifically the backup one. - This doesn't seem to happen anymore.
- Thai language isn't working? : https://discord.com/channels/339550825154347008/606565892142399488/817717202488524800 - This actually isn't a bug, the user probably didn't specify a font that has Thai characters in it and the default (my font) doesn't have those characters.

TODO

[ ] v0.8 Refactor
  - Rounded, cleaner, more visually appealing and bright, energetic design. No outlines (maybe even no anti-aliasing?)
  - Cards
    - Cards serve the same purpose as Tasks, but are slightly more advanced (and "Cards" as a name are more interesting and correct when compared to "Tasks", considering not every Task is completable)
    - Cards can be attached to other Cards visually, as well as by "pinning" them, making it possible to move a Card by moving its parent
    - Cards can be freely resized
      - Resized cards should go at a minimum size to comfortably house all non-customizeable elements on the Card
    - Cards can be edited largely right from the overview screen, without needing to open a separate Panel.
      - The maximum value for Progression Cards can be modified by simply double-clicking on the relevant text box.
    - Cards can be linked to show relationships by holding a key (Alt, for example), and clicking between Cards. These are explicit links; implicit links are still created by means of neighboring, as in MasterPlan v0.7.2.
      - These lines should be "bendable" in a customizeable way. Arrows or dots or something should maybe stream from Card to Card through these lines, thereby showing "flow".
    - Any text on Cards fade out if the Card isn't large enough to display the text element (a title, for example) fully
    - Text is parsed for URLs or program / OS file or program links
    - Cards are now at least 32x32 (test with higher-resolution fonts; if this isn't enough, then bump it up)
  - Re-implement Progression Cards
  [ ] Completable Tasks can have time estimations tied to them in some way.
  [x] Note Cards
    - Note Cards can contain stacks of information in a single Note.
  [x] Sound Cards
    - Add Seek bar
    - Add Volume bar
  [x] Image / GIF Cards
    - Freely rotatable by clicking and dragging outside of the corners
    - Paste images from system clipboard? See: https://github.com/golang-design/clipboard - Probably need to save image in project file itself in this case.
  - Line Tasks no longer exist (for now)
  - Copying Cards should now be global, rather than being localized to a single Project; maybe even better, it copies Cards straight to the OS buffer, which can be doubly-used for serialization and allows us to easily copy Cards between Projects, even with two Projects open at the same time
  - Top menu, for file / project settings, task editing, project information
    - Project information: Number of Tasks, number completed, time estimation
  - [x] Boards no longer exist; they are superceded by a Folder / Window / Board Card, which allows you to tie existing Cards to some mental and spatial context (a location on your project, as an example).
  - Custom shortcuts to, say, focus on a specific Card (so you can make a shortcut to jump to a Card, for example)
  - Themes - Maybe just straight-up replace them with images? It'd be kind of insane and futuristic to simply make it so that you can edit Themes by literally editing images so you can actually see what they look like?
  - Add ability to rebind selection + panning from being hard-coded to left and right-click, respectively.
  - Timer Cards
    - Timers should be able to count down.
  - Table Cards
    - Click on a + to add a new Row or Column,
    - Drag a row or column to reorder. Drag away from a Table to destroy that Row or Column.
    - Add numbers (?) for tables to allow for adding together the sums for comparison purposes - maybe an ability to switch it from Checkbox to Numbered Tables.
  - Sort Cards alphabetically? (somehow)
  - More zoom gradation? Might be doable if the cards are rendered at a high-enough resolution.
  - Template Cards - Could be useful if you have a "template" that you want to extend, like "Character Cards" with an image, a space for a description, and a space for class and skills,
  - Map Cards
    - Different colors for different zones
    - Icons for things like elevators, bricks, save points, player start position, town, enemies, npcs, etc
    - Legend for displaying text corresponding to icons or zones
      - Text from the legend should display behind the colors for each zone if possible (should be hide-able, perhaps only display if the Legend is open)
  - Calendar Card
  - Re-implement Project Settings
  - Re-implement copying and pasting text to and from MasterPlan to represent Card types.
  - Card Text cannot exceed 32768x32768; this can happen if the text or file is generally long. Some alternative to rendering the full text needs to be implemented. 
    - A possible solution could be to render the text from a file to a surface, which then gets clipped when rendering to a texture?

TTF font loading efficiently : foreign characters shouldn’t “cost” extra
Font base size “knowledge”
Text drawing efficiently
IME support (entry of foreign characters)
Ideally, different locale support (detection of the name of a key from a different locale, so the Q key becomes the A key on a FR keyboard locale)

Dialog editor of some description??? Seems like it could be sick to have some kind of system that would allow you to 

[ ] Flow-charts? See: https://discord.com/channels/339550825154347008/758009278756946040/848704269388742717 and https://discord.com/channels/339550825154347008/758009278756946040/848707386487341056

[ ] Graphs?
[ ] Move Board.CopyBuffer outside to a global variable so that it's possible to copy and paste between projects
[ ] Tab focusing (pressing tab focuses on different, consecutive elements in a panel)
[ ] Downloading images / sounds should be able to be saved to a local directory per-project (?)
[ ] Project.Modified is set directly after loading a project for some reason
[ ] Pasting large text files don't work (because it's rendering it to a texture; that might be too slow / run out of texture space)
[ ] Use URL Parsing to allow parsing text to point to other Tasks / Boards (boards are just Tasks on other Boards), or Projects so you can jump there with a click
[ ] Similarly, extend parsing to parse text to become clickable links to be able to open files or directories
[ ] Transparency and outlines don't mix
[ ] IME entry is still jank?
[ ] Paste Content crashes sometimes depending on text in clipboard?
[ ] Time for Timer > Date Mode
[ ] Dedicated media folder (drag and dropped files get automatically copied to a customizeable location): https://itch.io/t/1275925/option-to-copy-dragged-and-dropped-images-into-a-specific-folder-inside-masterplans-directory?before=3#post-2901238
[ ] Replace MapImage.Data's [][]int32 with [][]bool
[ ] Shifting drawings messes them up? 
[ ] Define UTI for Mac OS .plan files - seems like it should work if properly done? : https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/understanding_utis/understand_utis_declare/understand_utis_declare.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001319-CH204-SW1
[ ] Autosave should only happen when an UndoState is generated (possibly also when undoing / redoing); that's how we can know something happened.
[ ] Crash when pressing Reset Image Size on an unloaded image? : https://steamcommunity.com/app/1269310/discussions/1/3105766884450239608/
[ ] Make backup timer textbox move in steps of 5 minutes.
[ ] Lines shouldn't have to point in a specific direction / shouldn't point towards each other if possible
[ ] Implement text displaying better for fonts of different size; seems like they rarely line up properly 
[ ] Re-implement progress bar behind timer
[ ] Pasting the contents of a clipboard after directly copying a file prints some illegible characters which also mess up the textbox?
[ ] Can't make shortcut on Mac?
[ ] Building MasterPlan doesn't work sometimes?: https://github.com/SolarLune/masterplan/issues/39
[ ] See about implementing a backend system, switching from Raylib to SDL for (HOPEFULLY!) more up-to-date fundamentals (render-to-texture, texture unloading, better font support, better IME support).
[ ] Maybe a "Zone" type to "count" Tasks that exist within it for completion? Could be simpler than wiring a lot of Lines. Also, Zones could be collapsible, allowing you to hide Zones for simplicity and readability.
[ ] Calendar Task, allowing you to put Tasks on specific days (see TreeSheets: http://strlen.com/treesheets/docs/screenshots.html)
    - This will probably necessitate a Calendar UI element as well.
      - Maybe just a Calendar mode for the Table? That would basically turn it into a Table that has slots for each day in the month, and you could cycle through it using < and > buttons. It would have a max of 31 slots so the size is consistent, and the column headers would just be the day of the month. 
      - This should be more "in line with the design philosophy of MasterPlan", though; simply making it a Calendar works OK, but you can't put things into a Table. Maybe you should be able to? Maybe Note Tasks could be placed in there??? Maybe you could just put Zones into Tasks.
[ ] High-res fonts that are rendered to an image (for Notes, for example) is low-res
[ ] Optimize text rendering (just load at least the number of characters that we need?)
     - If I could reload fonts during run without crashing, that would be great
     - Another option would be to load 256 characters until you type a different character, then reload the font for that index? Something like that? Detect what characters you enter, and then reload the font up to the next stop beyond that character?
[ ] Remove Project.RetrieveResource()?
[ ] IMPLEMENT RL.UNLOADTEXTURE(), BECAUSE THIS VRAM MEMORY LEAK IS ANNOYING AS H*CK
[ ] Implement button to return all settings to default
[ ] Note renderering could use a grayscale texture for limited VRAM usage, as it's not necessary for Notes to be colored (for now)
[ ] Make a video talking a bit about what MasterPlan is and why it's useful. It helps you think, it helps you create links between tasks, it allows you to complete things that need to be done, and it helps you to say no. This video could be accessible from the Steam forums, or from the MasterPlan Settings (?) menu.
[ ] Note: If you save a project in a newer version of MasterPlan, loading it in an older version should say something like "Are you sure? It might not work correctly."
[ ] Optimize map image serialization by using bitwise operations and storing the array as a bitwise number
[ ] Add image filtering option, as you may not want it to be pixelly
[ ] Label each quadrant of a board?
[ ] Note color change
[ ] Show Map or Whiteboard size somewhere
[ ] List Tasks completed from those selected
[ ] Hide grid at far zoom levels
[ ] Textbox dies when there's a ton of text.
[ ] Add fill tool to Map Task.
[ ] Add diagonal corners to Map Task.
[ ] Make some kind of indication (maybe a little chain link icon) indicating a Task is linked to another, like a Timer or by a Line?
[ ] Logs should be created on each successful start, rather than putting them all into log.txt
[ ] Add option for log display time - this and the volume could be a new Slider GUI element.
[ ] Task Neighbors could contain loops sometimes; this should be resolved when establishing the neighbors.
[ ] Consolidate the Tasks that consist of Contents and Data Structures (somehow)
[ ] Dragging a task over a stack should attempt to insert it - might also be acceptable to simply make the keyboard shortcut to slide Tasks do this
[ ] Lines are drawing underneath Tasks (this could be configurable)
[ ] Move "Don't open at start" checkbox somewhere else, it being in About is kind of counter-intuitive
[ ] Draw text to a buffer, draw the buffer to the screen; might be considerably faster than drawing text constantly. Seems like 72% of non-sleep execution time might be spent drawing.
[ ] Tweakable zoom levels, rather than being hard-coded?
[ ] Use Lines to connect Tasks for SubTask counting
[ ] Fullscreen acts weird if the window isn't maximized first, so that might be a good thing to try to do? Set the window size and then fullscreen it?
[ ] Investigate pasting images from the clipboard?
[ ] Panels should be resizeable
[ ] A mobile version of MasterPlan, where you can take pictures or record video and have it copy over to your plan somehow (gasp!).
[ ] Re-make Dino Riki? Aw Nuts!? 7DRL on 3/4/21?!?!?!
[ ] Time estimations per Task - these can be set as a project-level default (i.e. something like 30 minutes per-Task), and then further specified (maybe specifying something like 3 hours for a specific Task, as an example).
[ ] Add manual typing entry for month / day / year for deadlines / Timer Dates
    Add option for MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD
[ ] Optimize Table text size checks
[ ] Table: Option to make coumn and row names invisible (so that you could for example put images there).
[ ] Table: Add button to turn a column into a row, or vice-versa
[ ] Add tags of some description
[ ] Add icons for task types in Task Edit Panel
[ ] Fix up horizontal alignments in Panels - rather than doing this via RowItem.Weight or HorizontalAlignment, it would be good to have a manual spacing value that indicates how far out from an item another is (how much space is between one item and the following one)
[ ] Changing font size shouldn't take so long - This could be simplified by making a selection for how many glyphs to load
[ ] Add seek option for Sounds - maybe they should be vertically two spaces tall? Maybe they should be able to EXPAND :O?
[ ] Deadline write-up by BiRD: https://discordapp.com/channels/339550825154347008/758009278756946040/810779087449751593
The summary is:
    - Use timers for timing and calendars for deadlines. Calendars are:
        - Visually focused (no extraneous information)
        - Intuitive (click a day = set the day)
        - Efficient (fewer actions to do the same thing)
        - Improvable (as a result of more available screen space)
        - Reusable (calendars can be used for more than just setting deadlines)
        - Fun (not sure what to write for this one)
[ ] Icon beside board name when due, deadlined, or late
[ ] Timers should be able to retroactively trigger if a set time was passed (somehow)
[ ] Task streaks (not sure exactly how this will work; maybe you can turn it on, and it will reset if a day passes between the previous time it was completed and the current day?)
[ ] Mini-map of some description?
[ ] Clickable images - when you click them, they go to a location.
[ ] Replace Board.UndoHistory with a project-level one
[ ] Go over the tutorial to explain things a bit more; right click to open the menu should be mentioned right at launch
[ ] Undo + Redo for textboxes
[ ] Add ability to delete shortcuts?
[ ] Vertical alignment isn't really centered for textboxes?
[ ] Hide status bar elements except for the search bar if there isn't enough room horizontally
[ ] Moveable status bar
[ ] Searchable shortcuts
[ ] Consolidate image and sounds into one task type?
[ ] Review libraries to see if the licenses are compatible with my own chosen license
[ ] Graph view that allows you to see your plan as a visual "node graph"? 
    See Nuclino: https://www.nuclino.com - It says it allows you to work in Boards and Graphs, 
    so maybe the Nodes on the Graphs should be clickable to reveal more information / reveal 
    the Task on the Board
[ ] Smooth out panel scrolling according to texture coords?       
[ ] Consolidate logging messages so messages that are the same get "compounded". For example:

00:00:00: "Selected 1 Tasks."
00:00:00: "Selected 1 Tasks."

becomes

00:00:00: "Selected 2 Tasks."

[ ] Improve search functionalities - present a list of Tasks that fulfill a set of 
[ ] Add image backgrounds instead of the grid.
[ ] Add other unicode characters to default font (←№⎢¡°ᚃ√⇒∄±∑∌≠αβχδεφγηιϑΧΔΦΓ)
[ ] Whiteboard resolution could be increased
[ ] Replace Board-level Undo with Project-level Undo, focus on Tasks when undoing or redoing
[ ] Clicking in the window when the window wasn't focused should be discarded
[ ] Display size for Tasks should be dependant on maximum theoretical feasible size (for example, a Progression Task should have a maximum size that 
  includes a current number and maximum number of 999 each, so that they don't change size when incrementing or decrementing)
[ ] Password protection
[ ] Copying tasks between Projects
[ ] Rotating and mirroring images
[ ] Optional compression of project JSON (it doesn't need to be readable if compressed) - a quick idea while still keeping it in plain text JSON format is to reduce the length of the strings I use to refer to Task elements, and turn off pretty printing before serialization to remove excess tab and return characters.
[ ] GIF Playback speed should be customizeable?
[ ] GIF step next frame / prev. frame
[ ] Make it so that it's easier to insert Tasks (i.e. dragging tasks into a list of them will automatically space them to make room)
[ ] Review ImmediateButton; lots of functions for what is effectively just one "thing".
[ ] Custom Justification for Task text
[ ] Custom prefix
[ ] Custom numbering system enabling for tasks
[ ] Option to indent Text with icons off
[ ] Resizeable Notes / Collapsible Notes
[ ] Background hint text for text entry (i.e. "Enter date in MM/DD/YYYY Format" behind something that allows you to enter a date)
[ ] Hover hints (i.e. hovering over certain elements will display a message relevant to the element you're hovering over). It would be nice if they had some visuals as well to assist with explanation (like screenshots).
[ ] Hover over Tasks to display more information about them (full task, creation date, completion date, etc).

Long-term Goals

- Multitask Editing
- Do stuff on the overview, rather than needing to open a Panel. This is requested pretty regularly, but I'm not 100% on how to do so seamlessly.
- Collaboration - Real quick idea: 
    - Clone the plan to all connected users' computers.
    - One person is host and the others are guests. This is mostly for internal purposes, the actual implementation shouldn't really make a huge distinction here.
    - Show each user's (colored / numbered, like P1, P2, etc., haha) mouse cursor on your screen.
    - Each Task can only be edited by one person at a time.
    - When a Task is changed (i.e. an UndoState is generated), send the updated version of the Task over the network to the other connected users.
    - Periodically, the host sends the entire serialized Project to all connected users for syncing.
    - Test ping to each person and suggest a host based on that.
    - Connection should be able to be done from within MasterPlan.
        - Through IP addresses. This could be simplified into some sort of simple alphabet-based code?
        - Perhaps through straight up some sort of code system so that you can easily join other "planners". It'd be interesting to join random "games", though 
        this would open up the possiblity of using MasterPlan for illegal or otherwise horrible activities, so this is probably not feasible.
    - Sending data should be UDP. Data could probably be compressed in some way so as not to send actual string data.
    - Chat window, of course

- Git integration (git messages can refer to Task IDs to automatically complete them)
- GUI Scaling
- Video streaming (i.e. from YouTube / Vimeo)
- Music streaming (i.e. from Spotify / SoundCloud (not sure if this is feasible, but I'd like to do it))
- Internationalization and translation to other common languages
- Charts and data visualization
