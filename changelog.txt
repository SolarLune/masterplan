-------

v0.8.0-alpha.8.1

-------

- QoL: Adding more audio playback buffer size options.
- QoL: Dropped files onto MasterPlan now create cards in the center of the window, rather than the mouse last was prior to exiting the window.
- FIX: Menus no longer disappear when the MasterPlan window is minimized on Windows.
- FIX: Swapping rows and columns in Tables now works properly (previously, swapping rows and columns had pressing a cell correspond to the transposed cell in the table).
- FIX: Tooltip bounds are sized properly now.
- FIX: Numbered cards now properly count for parent card, rather than over counting when the value is over the maximum.

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.8.0

-------
 
- RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Adding tables back in.
  Tables are useful to outline data in a matrix field, represented as an intersection of rows and columns. Rows and columns can be freely resized by clicking and dragging a row or column to rearrange. Double-clicking on the text allows you to edit that text. Tables can be visualized in a few different ways currently: as checkmarks, numbers, or grades (S - F). You can press tab and shift-tab to cycle between editing text for each element.
- QoL: Adding tooltip buttons to help explain unclear settings or options.
- QoL: Adding ability to edit multiple cards at the same time by holding the "Mulitple" key, (aka the "Add to Selection" key, which defaults to left shift).
  - When selecting / operating on multiple cards with the left-shift key, a + will appear next to the mouse cursor to indicate this.
  - Editing text is done by holding the multi-edit key and double-clicking on the text to edit. All selected cards will have their relevant text field updated by typing.
- QoL: Adding ability to move to next or previous card in stack by pressing "Next Card / Prev. Card" shortcuts (defaulting to Tab or Left Shift+Tab, respectively). Doing this while editing text will move to the next editable text in the next card up or down in the stack.
- QoL: Editing text or collapsing Cards now adjusts the rest of the stack. This isn't perfect, and I still have a lot more I want to do with stacks to improve usability and make them even more fun to work with.
- QoL: Adding a toggle-able text editing wrapping mode. The menu that displays this will appear at the top-right when editing text on a Card. You can press the button or press the keyboard shortcut to toggle between text wrapping modes (Ctrl+W when editing text).
  - There are two wrapping modes currently: Wrap, and Expand. Wrap will have cards grow downwards vertically, gaining more lines as you type beyond their borders. Expand will have cards grow horizontally when necessary.
- QoL: Adding name of project to loading prompt when you decide to load a project.
- QoL: Adding setting to change how numbered cards are displayed (either as percentage or current amount out of maximum).
- QoL: Numbered Cards now allow negative numbers.
- QoL: Numbered Cards now allow the current value to surpass the maximum.
- QoL: Highlighting text should be slightly more efficient than previously (though work still remains in this regard, and for optimization in general).
- FIX: Collapsing cards is now properly undo-able.
- FIX: Icons for applying colors to cards no longer change color depending on theme.
- FIX: When render textures are recreated (primarily done on Windows when the window is resized or altered), ensure they are never too small (0x0 in size). This might fix a crashing issue for Windows users.
- FIX: If a path cannot be made relative (on Windows, for example, if a piece of media points to an external drive), the path is saved and loaded unaltered. Note that this change might mean images don't save or load properly between the previous version and this one, so double-check when upgrading to ensure things work properly.
- Contribution by Peter0x44: Improve HOME/END text selection when editing text (previously this would only expand the selection, rather than select from the original position to the caret's new position).

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.7.3

-------

QoL: Mouse wheel scrolling is now more sensitive and tied to the Mouse Wheel Sensitivity Input setting.
QoL: Adding ability to cache downloaded resources. Caching downloaded resources works by specifying the per-project cache folder in Settings > General Settings. Any downloaded images, sounds, etc. will be stored here, instead of being placed in the temporary directory. When loading a project, these same locations will be used to load the images, meaning that downloaded resources will only be downloaded once; after that, they'll be pulled from the cache directory. If the cache directory doesn't exist, then it will work as it normally does (downloading to the temporary directory).
QoL: Pasting text into MasterPlan now creates a more logically sized card, rather than a super wide one.
QoL: Double-clicking to edit labels no longer adjusts the caret position.
QoL: Page Up and Page Down now advance 5 lines when editing text.
QoL: Adding icons, accessible through a menu in the View menu. Icons are automatically packaged with MasterPlan and serve to allow you to easily add images that represent characters, locations, ideas, etc. to your project for visual representation. The packaged icon set will be improved and expanded upon as time passes, and it may even be possible to easily add user-created icons in the future.
QoL: Make left/right arrow keys move the cursor to the start/end of a selection.
QoL: Don't draw caret if a selection is open.
QoL: Arrows are outlined now.
QoL: Adding ability to delete the last word with Left Ctrl + Backspace.
QoL: Adding ability to select all text before or after the caret with Left Shift + Home or End.
QoL: Multi-line log messages now are indented on the following lines for better readability.
QoL: Adding option to disable grid disappearing on zoom out.
QoL: Adding ability to color card contents, just like card backgrounds can be colored.
QoL: Adding settings to change audio playback buffer size and audio sample-rate. These settings can be useful if the default audio playback settings don't allow you to play audio back, or if sounds sound bad when played back. Note that changing these settings take effect only after restarting MasterPlan.
QoL: Adding broken image icon for images that have invalid filepaths.
OPTIMIZATION: Cards won't draw the card or shadow if they're not at least partially onscreen.
FIX: Saving screenshots to a project now properly loads them back.
FIX: When editing a map, holding the color pick key now will pick a color only if a tool is selected, making it easier to deselect cards if that is the same key (which it is by default - Left Alt).
FIX: Lines / links now draw on top of other cards.
FIX?: MasterPlan will no longer attempt to create a larger render texture than the graphics card can support (this might happen when updating text).
FIX: Deadlines are now included in exports.
FIX: You can now click buttons that are over a Map while editing.
FIX: Being unable to create sounds due to sound files not being compatible with MasterPlan no longer crashes MasterPlan, but rather displays a warning log message.
FIX: Toggling debug mode is disabled in non-development versions of MasterPlan.
FIX: Starting MasterPlan no longer crashes if the audio system cannot be initialized.

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.7.2

-------

QoL: Adding jump button next to pages in hierarchy view.
QoL: Orphaned page names are now darker than normal page names.
FIX: Cards are now again placed in the center of the screen if the option to place new cards in a stack is disabled.
FIX: When cards automatically resize when typing text, other cards that move to make room now properly are moved when undoing / redoing.
FIX: Exporting now only exports pages that have not been deleted.
FIX: Menu to go up from a sub-page now appears again if opening a project from within a subpage (specifically, the last subpage in the project).
FIX: If a page has no accessible path to the route, it is now considered deleted (if in a normal project) or orphaned (if in a project that already contains orphaned pages).
Note: When loading a project with orphaned pages, deleted / inaccessible pages will show up in the Hierarchy view as "orphans" - this allows you to get at their contents. When saving a project with orphan pages, as long as they have no contents, they will be deleted. The change here is that if a project has no orphans, deleted pages will not be accessible from the hierarchy.

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.7.1

-------

HOT-FIX RELEASE: Images should now load on Linux. This was broken previously because the relative paths were mistaken to be URLs (which they weren't, of course).

RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Adding option to place newly created cards in a stack if a card is selected (defaulting to off). If the option is enabled, Cards created through keybindings or through the Create menu will be inserted into the stack underneath the currently selected Card.
OPTIMIZATION: Resizing images no longer unnecessarily uses additional VRAM. (Internally, resizing images doesn't need to recreate the owning Card as the image doesn't show the card in the first place.)
FIX: Images and sounds should no longer cause crashes when linked from a drive apart from the one MasterPlan starts on.
FIX: Crashes should actually write vital information to the log file again, rather than inexplicably cutting that part out.
FIX: MP should no longer crash when selecting non-existing cards in a direction (i.e. pressing right with no card to the right).
FIX: Creating a new project while in a subpage will no longer have the "exit subpage" window stuck onscreen.
QoL: More efforts to improve memory usage / free memory more aggressively, particularly when creating new projects / loading other projects in sequence. Please let me know if this doesn't work!
QoL: Adding maximum image size buffer with customizeable size. Images that are larger than this buffer size will be scaled down to fit in this size when added to a project. The size will be capped to a maximum value of whatever your graphics card will support. The smaller the image buffer size, the smaller the images will be scaled when loading (meaning less fine details when zooming in on your project), and so the less VRAM they will consume. This setting takes effect on newly loaded resources (so change the option and then reload the project or restart MasterPlan to see the effect).
QoL: MasterPlan now saves which page you're on when you save the project.
QoL: Keybindings to select top or bottom card in Stack now default to Home / End, rather than Page Up / Page Down.
QoL: Adding keybindings to select top or bottom card in the selected Card's indentation group (Page Up / Page Down).
QoL: Adding keybinding to select all cards in indentation group or below. (Left Ctrl+Space).
  -  For previous users, with these added keybinding changes in mind, please look over the shortcuts to ensure there are no keybinding conflicts (or reset the keybindings to default to avoid having conflicts).
QoL: MasterPlan should now prefer using the dedicated GPU over the integrated GPU on Windows for computers that have the option.
QoL: Disabled buttons are now darker, and button choices for button groups are now slightly lighter (60% > 70% brightness).

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.7

-------

RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Deadlines have now been reimplemented. Deadlines are set from the Edit menu, and following the philosophy of new MasterPlan, multiple Cards can have their deadlines set at a time. In the View > Deadlines menu, you can also see the currently active and completed deadlines in your project, sorted in order of urgency.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Image, Sound, and Link file paths are now saved in relative path notation (i.e. "../icon.png" for a file named "icon.png" in the folder above MasterPlan's executable). This should play more nicely when loading projects from different locations as long as its resources are in the same locations relative to the project. Note that this relativity doesn't apply for the arguments section of a Link Card set File Mode.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: The Home and End keys now once again jump to the beginning or end of editable text.

QoL: Implementing v0.7 project loading. Note that 0.8 still does not have all features of 0.7, so some features (standalone lines, whiteboards, tables, among possibly others I haven't foreseen) are going to be missing. Otherwise, MasterPlan v0.8 will let you know when you load a v0.7 project through a message at the bottom-left. After loading it, you'll need to save manually in a location - it would probably be best NOT to save over your original v0.7 project. Please do feel free to let me know if any v0.7 projects don't load in v0.8!
QoL: Adding ability to export projects to PDF / PNG. Exporting allows you to export your project to either a series of PNG files (one for each page) or a PDF file (one PDF file, but one page in the PDF file per page in MasterPlan). The Export option is visible in the Tools menu.
QoL: Lowering MasterPlan's memory usage floor by ~60% in cases where a project's pages are largely empty. (Internally, this is done by making it so the backing collision grid is only 1x1 and grows as necessary, rather than starting out at 1000x1000 and growing from there.)
QoL: Editing text on cards now will automatically resize the card vertically when necessary.
QoL: When editing text on a Card, the camera will move if the caret gets too close to the edge of the window.
QoL: Adding ability to grab color from the first selected card when coloring Cards in the Set Color menu.
QoL: Adding Tools menu, moving Flatten Project to Tools menu. 
QoL: Adding Take Screenshot menu entry to Tools menu. (It has always been possible to take a screenshot, it's just been only accessible via a keybinding until now.)
QoL: Adding project settings option to zoom to cursor when zooming in or out - note that this does not take effect when setting the zoom level directly using the number keys.
QoL: Adding project settings option to enable / disable shadows.
QoL: The grid now will disappear if you zoom out beyond 100%, rather than only beyond the previous zoom level (50%).
QoL: Starting MasterPlan on a Linux distribution without qarma, matedialog, or zenity will inform you to install one of these missing dependencies (sorry KDE users, I'll need to address this somehow!).
QoL: Renaming arrow connection shortcuts to "Connect Cards" and "Disconnect All Links".
QoL: Renaming "Smooth movement" to "Smooth panning + zoom" in settings.
QoL: Minor graphical tweaks to UI to improve visibility.

CHANGE: "Stack lines" are now outlined.
CHANGE: Making shadows slightly darker and partially transparent.

FIX: Setting color using hex string no longer has an inaccurate value / brightness - this was noticeable when setting the color using a hex string, but with a darker than 100% value.
FIX: Cards now correctly set their undo state regardless of if they're onscreen or not. (Previously, this wasn't the case, and Cards being offscreen would cause them to not update their undo state when doing things that affect them, like changing their color, for example.)
FIX: Deleting sub-page cards no longer creates orphan pages.
FIX: GIFs linked from the internet should now load properly when loading the project.
FIX: Dropdown menus now extend downwards into space properly depending on the currently selected (multiline) option, rather than there being a massive space at the bottom when they're open (this can be seen specifically in the "Transparency Mode" menu).
FIX: Custom fonts with empty glyphs no longer crash MasterPlan.
FIX: Foreign / non-English latin characters (like Ç) no longer create a blank line in editable text. They also are now  properly stepped through with the keyboard arrow keys / word jumping.

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.6.1

-------

Quickie hotfix for Alpha 6:

QoL / FIX: Cards now only update if they are on the current page, unless they are timers (as timers still have to tick). This is an optimization, and also a fix for an issue where double-clicking causes seemingly random sub-pages to open (in truth, this is because they were still being updated and "existing", despite the user not being on their page).
QoL: Editing the filepath of image and sound cards now automatically highlights the filepath text to edit. Note that this is not done for Link cards linking to programs because you may wish to edit the arguments instead of the filepath, so you can choose.
QoL: Adding keyboard shortcuts to edit the description text of Checkbox, Note, Numbered, Timer, Sub-Page and Link Cards (defaulting to Enter).
QoL: Orphaned pages (pages that you can't reach from an existing Sub-page Card) are named as such in the Hierarchy menu.
QoL: MasterPlan will let you know if you attempt to paste something from your system clipboard and it's empty.
QoL: MasterPlan will let you know if you attempt to paste filepaths that it can't automatically detect.
QoL: Adding Spearmint theme.
QoL: Reworking empty image graphic to be visually clearer.
FIX: Saving a screenshot to the project no longer causes a message indicating a temporary already exists to pop up.
FIX: Canceling browsing for a file for cards (i.e. for Image, Sound, and Link cards) no longer causes a message indicating the user canceled it to pop up.
FIX: Cards that have been saved from the clipboard to the project can no longer be edited to point to other images (since this would cause those other images to also be saved).
FIX: Images that are downloaded from the internet are no longer attempted to save directly in the project.
FIX: Orphaned pages (pages that aren't pointed to from an existing Sub-page Card) are no longer saved if they have no cards in them when saving the project.
FIX?: Images linked from the internet should properly display after loading the project now?

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.6

-------

QoL: Adding Hierarchy menu. This menu allows you to see your project at a glance with each card listed under its named page. You can filter out cards by card type, or sort them alphabetically or by position on the page.
QoL: If MasterPlan crashed when attempting to autoload a project, it won't automatically try to load that project again when restarted.
QoL: Sub-page Card screenshots now resize to fill the Card, rather than being cropped.
QoL: You can now double-click on Sub-page Cards to open them, rather than needing to press their Open buttons.
QoL: Zoom goes out to 5% now, instead of 25% minimum. Adding a shorcut for this zoom level as well.
QoL: Adding Flatten Project tool to Edit menu. This tool allows you to pull all cards from sub-pages and place them into the main / root page.
QoL: Reworked map and image icons for enhanced readability.
QoL: Adding keyboard shortcut to open the help documentation on Github.
QoL: Adding keyboard shortcuts (the function keys, by default), to open the Create, Edit, Hierarchy, and Stats menus.
QoL: Scrolling through menus via the mouse wheel is now absolute, rather than being relative to the overall "height" of the menu.
QoL: MasterPlan will now warn you on load if a project contains orphaned pages (pages that cannot be reached through sub-pages).
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Re-implementing automatic backups.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Re-implementing Cut Card context menu option / keyboard shortcut.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Adding mouse wheel sensitivity for scrolling menus.
FIX: Files that no longer exist will now be removed from the Open Recent... menu. This triggers when any project is attempted to be loaded.
FIX: Loading a recent project now properly closes the file menu.
FIX: Triggering Find to find a Card on another page no longer deselects the text (i.e. Ctrl+F no longer cancels out editing the find text).
FIX: MasterPlan should no longer crash if a Card is too large (i.e. if it requests a texture of a size that is too large for the video card to generate. Instead, the texture size will be capped).
FIX: MasterPlan should, again, no longer save sub-pages incorrectly.
FIX: MasterPlan should, again, be compiling partially statically on Linux, such that SDL is no longer a dynamic dependency (so you shouldn't have to install SDL to use MasterPlan).
FIX: Quick hot-fix to fix not being able to click buttons in the context menu. Whoops!
FIX: Also fixes the context menu contents being in the previous position for a single frame.
FIX: Link Cards can now have customized colors.
FIX: Window transparency will be more accurately set / the window won't be very slightly transparent sometimes.
CHANGE: Keyboard shortcuts have been edited, so be aware of this - you may wish to reset all shortcuts to default, to ensure there's no keyboard shortcut conflicts.
CHANGE: Previous sub page menu is now at the bottom-center, by default.
Adding basic roadmap on Github: https://github.com/SolarLune/masterplan/wiki/Roadmap

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.5

-------

Adding the Link Card type. The Link Card can be used to link to another card, either on the current page or another sub-page. This is done by pressing the Link button - after a Card is linked, the card will change color slightly and an icon will appear, indicating a link is established. Pressing the "Jump" button on the Card (or pressing Enter) will then jump to the target location. Link Cards can also be set to link to programs or files on your computer and can open them right from MasterPlan. Pressing "Execute", in this case, will attempt to run or open the file as applicable.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: You can now move and select cards via the keyboard. Moving cards in this way will attempt to have them swap with their neighbors.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: You can now again skip numbering top-level cards (so they can serve as categories, effectively).
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Adding option to outline the window in a colored rectangle.
QoL: Adding window transparency.
QoL: Arrows no longer point to Cards quite so oddly.
QoL: Keybindings can be searched by key / mouse button name as well now, rather than just by shortcut name.
QoL: The rows for each shortcut in the keybindings section now have alternating background colors for readability.
QoL: The screenshot area for subpages are now shown by means of a rectangle and a small camera icon beneath the sub-page name displayed on the grid background.
QoL: Loading projects now outputs more information to logs.
QoL: Separating keybinding for open / close sub-page out to two separate bindings.
QoL: Adding setting to focus on cards when undoing or redoing.
QoL: Add Log message when disconnecting all arrows from a Card via the keyboard shortcut.
QoL: MasterPlan should now be built at least partially statically moving forward, making for a smoother experience on Linux without the need to install SDL-related dependencies.
QoL: You can now use zooming and panning shortcuts while connecting Cards via arrows.
CHANGE: Moving borderless window to Visual options section.
CHANGE: Rewording some shortcut names.
MINOR CHANGE: The bar in scrollbars are now colored and positioned properly.
FIX: Map palette no longer closes when clicking away from the editing map.
FIX: Maps are no longer blank right after autoloading on Windows.
FIX: A single path in the Open Recent... menu is now no longer blank.
FIX: Moving from subpages where you're editing text now properly deactivates the text editing mode. This also fixes the inability to use shortcuts after leaving the subpage in this case.
FIX: Create menu is now sized a bit more properly.
FIX: MP no longer crashes if the custom font path is a directory.
FIX: Copying sub-pages no longer reference the original page. Instead, the copy just has the name and leads to a new, blank page. NOTE: This applies to any existing v0.8 saves with multiple sub-pages referencing a page.
FIX: MP no longer crashes if placing cards too far away from the center. Previously, this was about the distance away from the edge of the grid as that is from the center.
FIX: Minor fix - copying and pasting cards now only displays a message if cards are actually selected / in the paste buffer to do so.
FIX: Don't allow numbered cards to have negative tasks completed (Thanks, @Peter0x44!)
FIX: MP no longer crashes if a theme lacks a color for an element. Instead, the event is logged at the bottom-left and the element is colored bright pink to destroy your optic nerve for making such an obvious mistake you piping hot fool.
FIX: MP no longer crashes if opened when using a theme that no longer exists. Now it defaults to Sunlight if the theme is no longer available for whatever reason.
FIX: Cards that are linked via arrows with a joint and placed very closely to the joint won't point to the top-left corner of the screen.
FIX: Saving a project should now work a bit more reliably as we now manually sync the changes to disk after writing the file out.
FIX: Contextual buttons above Maps and Images now are colored properly regardless of theme.
FIX: Creating Cards via the Create menu now selects them automatically.
MINOR FIX: Pressing Enter / Return when editing text no longer triggers the key press for shortcuts that use it.
MINOR FIX: Horizontal spacing improved for rows of elements with manually defined spacing.
-------

v0.8.0-alpha.4.2

-------

RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Adding movement smoothing. Defaults to on; turning it off makes movement, zooming, and scrolling absolute, rather than smoothed.
QoL: Removing "colored area" around editable text labels.
QoL: Fix text rendering artifacts on menus. (Thanks, @ishidex2!)
QOL: If path names in the Open Recent menu have the same filename, more of the path will be displayed to make it unambiguous. (Thanks, @ishidex2!)
FIX: The completion color for custom colored Cards is now tweaked slightly for enhanced visibility.
FIX: MasterPlan no longer crashes when saving pages when subpages were created out of order.

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.4.1

-------

QoL: Menus can now be anchored. By dragging them to a side or corner of the screen, they will stay there even after resizing MasterPlan's window.
QoL: The main menu can now be moved from the top-left corner and positioned wherever you want.
QoL: Either of the Find Next or Find Prev. keybindings now open the Find menu. Related to this, there is no longer a need for the keybinding to summon the Find Menu, specifically, and so it has been removed.
QoL: Using Find Next or Find Prev. to cycle through found Cards now highlights the text to search for, making it easier to quickly look for several cards in sequence.
QoL: Adding keybinding to remove all links from the currently selected Card.
FIX: Removing a joint in a link now properly generates an undo state.
FIX: Creating a joint just creates one undo state (after dropping it).
FIX: Some menus' buttons were largely invisible with some themes (internally, this was due to IconButtons defaulting to white). This is now resolved.
FIX: MP no longer crashes when presing the Clear button in the Find menu when first summoning it.
FIX: Find menu now properly loops through all found Cards when searching (previously, it would loop erratically, sometimes selecting the same Card twice).
FIX / QoL: You can now use the Find menu to search sub-pages (previously, it only searched the current page).
FIX: MasterPlan no longer crashes when loading projects featuring subpages that were created out of order (i.e. if you created two subpages, deleted them, created one more, and then saved the project).
FIX: MasterPlan no longer crashes if a card was in a stack when linking (via a line) to another card above in that stack.
FIX: Don't log "Deleted 0 Cards." when pressing delete without having a card selected.

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.4

-------

IMPROVEMENT: Adding sub-pages. A sub-page is a card that allows you to access another page, thereby giving you more means of planning and organizing your project.
IMPROVEMENT: Adding a "Help" link to File menu. The help link takes you to a wiki, located on the Github repo for MasterPlan. The Help wiki will serve as a useful online central reference on using MasterPlan, and will be updated as MasterPlan grows.
IMPROVEMENT: Adding customizeable colors. Cards' colors can now be customized using the Edit > Set Color menu.
IMPROVEMENT: Sounds can now trigger other Cards on playback completion when placed in a vertical stack, or when connected via links.
IMPROVEMENT: Line arrowheads now will have a black outline if they have a white fill color (like images).
IMPROVEMENT: Adding buttons to shift map elements around from the palette menu.
IMPROVEMENT: Adding Stop All Sounds keybinding.
IMPROVEMENT: Shadows are no longer transparent and aren't as dark.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Reimplementing the ability to take screenshots (defaults to F11).
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Reimplementing the borderless window option.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Reimplementing the option to automatically load the last opened project.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Reimplementing loading a plan from file system by double-clicking on it in Windows (I believe) or by passing in the path to the plan as the first argument when starting MasterPlan.
QoL: Cards and menus are now resizeable from all sides, not just the right and bottom.
QoL: Cards can now only be resized when selected (which makes selecting cards easier, since you no longer have to worry about accidentally resizing a card when you mean to click on it).
QoL: Messages that repeat are now combined (i.e. spamming Ctrl+Z becomes "Undo event triggered. x10" instead of creating 10 individual "Undo event triggered" messages).
QoL: Line arrowheads now use the main color, rather than the outline color (again).
Reeeeeeeeal quick QoL: Resizing multiple cards now requires holding the new resize cards shortcut (left-shift by default), which means moving multiple cards is easier.
QoL: Adding Deselect all cards shortcut (Left Ctrl + Left Shift + A).
CHANGE: Focus on Cards now defaults to Left Shift + F.
CHANGE: Removing overview devlog button (as the overview video is old).
CHANGE: Adding Moss, Terra Cotta, and NS-DOSS themes.
CHANGE: Focusing on Cards now zooms into the Card as well.
FIX: Sound play button now properly changes back to play when the Sound is stopped.
FIX: Changing fonts no longer causes maps to turn invisible.
FIX: MasterPlan internally refreshing textures (i.e. when resizing the window on Windows or changing fonts) no longer leaks RAM / VRAM like a son of a gun.
FIX: Short messages (that appear at the bottom-left) now appear long enough and are timed properly.
FIX: The keybinding to unlock the aspect ratio when scaling an image now properly works when holding the key.
FIX: The Menu close button no longer is always white, but rather changes color according to the theme.
FIX: Maps no longer internally each create their own palette menu (whoops). They share one menu now, of course, thereby lowering memory usage.
FIX: Undoing now works correctly when loading projects.
FIX: You can no longer open the context menu (right click) while a fullscreen prompt is open.
FIX: You can now undo and redo while editing text or with the context menu open.
FIX: Themes refresh every second when the Visual Settings menu is open.
FIX: Loading projects should no longer set the project's modified status.
FIX: Pasting cards from the context menu pastes them from where the menu opens, rather than from where you click on the "Paste Cards" menu.
FIX: Numbering is no longer broken, displaying a variety of 0's, for when a card is underneath a non-numberable card (like a Note).
FIX: Non-numberable cards (like Notes) placed between a parent and its numberable children no longer break dependency in a stack.
FIX: Projects should no longer save links between cards incorrectly. Again. Internally, this was because it was previously possible to create cards that shared IDs, thereby making them link incorrectly when the project is loaded. This should fix the issue. (Although you will need to re-create the previously broken links and resave your project. Sorry!)

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.3

-------

Double-click settings (save previous task type, double-click to create a card) have been combined into a single dropdown.
Adding option to search for keybindings.
Rewording some shortcuts.
Adding confirmation on quit, new project, or load project.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Saving includes the camera location and zoom.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Adding project name and "MODIFIED" status to titlebar. The modified status is set when something in the project changes that necessitates the creation of an undo state.
RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Adding Load Recent... menu.
FIX: Links between cards that are directly next to each other no longer glitch out and point to the top-left infinitely.
FIX: Text on cards no longer looks like crap on edges for some characters (this was due to clearing the renderer result buffer using transparent black instead of transparent white).
FIX: Switching from one content type to another no longer deselects the current tool for Maps.
FIX: You can no longer undo the loading of a project.
FIX: Lines that have no color (like from images) now have black outlines.
FIX: You can now more easily click on line endings or nodes that are on top of Cards.
CHANGE: Line arrows are now colored instead of white.
FIX: You no longer accidentally click on something in the background by clicking on a button in a menu that then closes.

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.2

-------

Note: The saving and loading system for lines have been reworked, and so you will need to recreate any lines between Cards on your projects after loading in alpha 2. Apologies!

- Adding ability to create joints in links between Cards.
  To create joints, click on the circle at the center of a link. To delete a joint, double-click on one. You can move all joints in a link by simply moving both cards at the ends of the link.
- Lines have been visually simplified; they no longer have "dots" traveling from start to end, but are rather simply lines that have arrows that point to the ending Card.
- You can now indicate dependency with links between Cards.
  For example, you can link a Checkbox to a Numbered Card to indicate that the Checkbox will be completed when the Numbered Card is completed.
- Adding ability to resize menus and Cards from bottom and right, in addition to just the bottom-right corner.
- Adjusting area around Cards for resizing. Previously it wrapped around the Card's right and bottom completely; now, it leaves a small gap at the left and top edge, allowing for the resize border of a neighboring card to be easily reachable. Conclusion: It's now easier to consistently resize cards that are in a stack, despite the area being smaller overall.
- Adding option to reverse panning in the Input menu.
- Re-implementation: Whatever card you previously created will be what is created when double-clicking.
- Adding setting to turn this off - if off, double-clicking will always create a Checkbox card.
- It's now possible to resize multiple cards by simply selecting multiple cards and then resizing one of them. The others will copy the one you're resizing.
- The line underneath text (editable text, specifically) now draws underneath the first line of text. By entering a newline, you can create a "title" that sits on the line.
- Selecting Cards by any means will raise them now, not only by directly clicking on them.
- Messages now take longer to display in proportion to their length, making them easier to read.
- RE-IMPLEMENTATION: You can now use a custom font for use in MasterPlan by specifying a .ttf or .otf file.
  Note that doing this rebuilds the font glyphs used for displaying text, and so text may not display correctly until restarting MasterPlan. 
  This is planned to be improved, though it's not a pressing issue.
- RE-IMPLEMENTATION: Checkboxes are now able to serve as parent Tasks / Cards by having them at the head of a stack. 
  An indicator of its childrens' completion will appear at the right-hand side, and the icon for the parent Card will change to a set of squares. 
  All children and grand-children are included in the count.
- RE-IMPLEMENTATION: You can now properly paste todo lists in as plain text and paste them into MasterPlan as Cards. 
  For Checkbox Cards, use [ ] at the beginning of the list. 
  For Numbered Cards, use the same format, but with numbers inside ( like [13/209] ).
- CHANGE: Reworking the Checkbox icon for the umpteenth time.
- CHANGE: Resizing rectangle size is now 16 pixels large; it was previously 32 pixels large.
- CHANGE: Linking cards now uses the color white as opposed to the menu color if the linking card has no color (like images).
- CHANGE: Lines are now a smidge thicker.
- FIX: Panning has been fixed. Previously, it was both way too sensitive or not sensitive enough depending on how slowly or quickly you moved the mouse.
- FIX: Lines anchor to Cards more naturally.
- FIX: Lines are now copied properly when copying Cards.
- FIX: Lines between Cards should be tied together properly now.
- FIX: The Numbered Card's text is now properly centered.
- FIX: Undoing and redoing handles card link creation or deletion properly.
- FIX: Pasting a Card with a filled background bar (like a Numbered card or a parented Checkbox card) no longer has the bar start at an infinite length.
- FIX: Cards no longer draw their number even if they're deleted.
- FIX: Targa (.tga) image files are now properly loaded and displayed.
- FIX: MasterPlan no longer crashes when loading JPEG files on Windows - this was due to a missing DLL file (libjpeg-9.dll).
- FIX: MasterPlan should no longer crash when loading TIFF files on Windows - if it was happening, it was probably due to a missing DLL file (libtiff-9.dll).
- FIX: Timers should trigger properly now.
- FIX: Timer mode, trigger mode, and maximum time are now properly saved.

-------

v0.8.0-alpha.1.2

-------

- Replacing Quicksand with NotoSans font for clarity / increased character count (so now extended latin characters like "αβχδεφγηιγη" can be used).
- Time estimation now takes into account maximum number of steps in Numbered tasks (i.e. more steps = a longer task, with each step taking the amount of time in the time estimation panel).
- FIX: Textures becoming invisible when resizing the window on Windows. This happens specifically when changing / resetting the SDL context.
- FIX: Panning is now consistent regardless of zoom.

v0.8.0-alpha.1

Like, everything's better. More documentation to come later, but the broadstrokes can be seen in this video: https://youtu.be/43sotReXnGA

-------

v0.7.2

-------

Panels are now resizeable.
Added tab focusing (pressing tab focuses on different, consecutive elements in a panel).
Multiple log files are now created for each time you run the program; a maximum of 20 is maintained.
Screenshorts are now named by date-time, not just numerically, allowing for multiple sets of screenshots across multiple sessions of MasterPlan.
FIX: Paste Content crashes sometimes depending on text in clipboard
FIX: Checkbox button now properly matches the Task's position.
FIX: The Project's modified state (the *, for example, in the title bar of MasterPlan) is no longer incorrectly set directly after loading a project.
FIX: URL buttons are no longer misaligned.
FIX: The camera is now locked to pixels for exactness.

-------

v0.7.1

-------

- Audio samplerate no longer defaults to 22050 hz on Mac OS.
- Adding ability to click on Checkbox Tasks to check them off.
- Adding ability to drag and drop .plan files onto MasterPlan to load them.
- Backup filename format has been tweaked (for example, from "test.plan_bak_3.1.21.15.04" > "test.plan_bak_03_01_21_15_04").
- Adding customizeable audio sample buffer size. A sample buffer size of 2048 seems to be a good default that should resolve crackly sound for most users. If the sound is crackly, try raising it.
- Adding ability to copy Tasks into the system clipboard to paste as text, with a corresponding option in Settings to disable as desired.
- Adding ability to paste text content list that starts with "[ ]", "[x]", or "[o]" as Checkbox Tasks. Copy text that starts with "[ ]" to copy it in as an incomplete Checkbox; text that starts with "[x]" or "[o]" get copied in as complete.
- Removing Square and Star numbering sequences for now, to try to move over to pure letters / unicode characters for text-related rendering to make spacing simpler, rather than having icons in there, too (or, this could be, ideally, revisited again with better-looking icons).
- Settings > Global menu is now categorized to make things a bit easier to find.
- Added shortcuts to add or delete columns and rows. Shift+Enter goes to the previous column or row, Enter goes to the next one. If the last column or row is highlighted, Enter will create a new one. Pressing backspace when a column or row's name is empty will delete it.
- Warning messages that appear at the top-left are now yellow.
- Adding double-clicking sensitivity option in Settings.
- Underlined text in panels are now a bit visually nicer, being slightly thicker, wider, and fading out on the edges.
- Other minor visual fixes.
- FIX: Multi-character entry with IMEs (like typing multiple characters / kanji in Japanese) should work correctly now; previously, only the first character was entered.
- FIX: Sound streams are properly resampled now when changing project sampler settings.
- CHANGE: Audio settings (sample rate and volume) are now global, not per-Project, and are available in the Global section of the settings menu. The Audio section is now removed.
- FIX: Saving no longer stutters slightly, making Project Auto-save usable again.
- FIX: MasterPlan warns you when you haven't saved the project and have Auto-Save enabled.
- FIX: MasterPlan warns you when you try to exit or load a new project, and Auto-Save isn't working (for the above reason).
- FIX: Stopwatches are now able to be started again; previously, they couldn't be started under certain circumstances.
- FIX: Stopwatches can now be reset again.
- FIX: Files with upper-case extensions (i.e. JPG instead of jpg) weren't visible on Linux when attempting to load images or sounds from disk.
- FIX: Textboxes now update if the font changes.
- FIX: Checkbox / Progression / Note / Sound / Timer Tasks now properly recalculate their size when the font or font size changes.
- FIX: Task-specific shortcuts should now only work when the project is in a neutral state (search textbox not focused, task isn't being edited, etc). This means it's not possible to, say, complete a Checkbox while a Panel is open.
- FIX: URL buttons appear when the project is in neutral state only.
- FIX: Textboxes are now more properly aligned horizontally.
- FIX: Lines from Line tasks now always display, not just if both the base and the end are visible.
- FIX: Overdue Tasks no longer skip a day around Daylight Savings Time starting.
- FIX: Time until Daily Timer goes off is no longer incorrect around DST: https://github.com/SolarLune/masterplan/issues/50
- FIX: Messages that are spawned by processes that take some time (i.e. when using Save Project As...) now properly show up. Internally, this is because messages now fade out over by ideal delta frame-time, rather than fading by the system clock.
- FIX: Text pasted into MasterPlan on Windows no longer adds an underscore on every line.
- FIX: It's not longer possible to paste a Line base that has been deleted after copying. (This created an orphaned base.)
- FIX: Pasting a Line ending that was deleted after copying now no longer creates an orphaned arrow.
- FIX: Double-clicking no longer triggers if the two clicks are on different objects. For example, clicking once on a Task and then on the background no longer registers as a double-click on the background.
- FIX: Double-clicking is now slightly easier by default (0.33 seconds > 0.5 seconds).

v0.7.0-1

-------

FIX: Lines no longer stop the selection box from showing.
FIX: Switching from Table to another Task type and back no longer crashes.

-------

v0.7.0

-------

MASSIVE update. Huge rewrite of the interior of MasterPlan; still tons of work to do.

NOTE: It would be wise to back up your plans prior to loading them in the new version of MasterPlan, just to ensure no data is lost.
Also, there were some changes to keyboard shortcuts. Please check them after loading MasterPlan up again.

[*] Added basic support for non-latin / foreign character entry. Note that you have to specify a font that has the characters you'll be entering (as the default one only has latin characters).
[*] Tasks now open, move, and expand more smoothly.
[*] Completely reworked the Undo system; should be slightly more optimized (and is simpler in the code-base, as well).
[*] Completely rewrote a large portion of the Task update and drawing system; may be more optimized, but it is now primarily simpler in the code-base.
[*] Tables have been added. A Table is a grid of checkboxes you can click to toggle them, with customizeable, reorderable headers on the left and top indicating names.
[*] Downloading images / sounds are now multithreaded.
[*] Modifiers (left ctrl, right ctrl) are now left / right agnostic.
[*] Now ONLY Check-box Tasks display Sub-Tasks as contributing to their own completion, not any other completable Tasks.
[*] Added a Daily mode for Timers (so a Timer can trigger every Monday, Friday, etc).
[*] Added a Date mode for Timers (so a Timer can trigger on a specific date).
[*] Added a Stopwatch mode for Timers.
[*] Added a repeatable option for certain Timer types.
[*] Timers now can trigger neighbor Tasks when they run out. The effect of the trigger differs depending on the Task type - Completable Tasks change their completion level, while Whiteboard Tasks change their colors. Timers start or stop when triggered, naturally.
[*] Timers who are neighbors to Lines can now trigger the Tasks those Lines are pointing to, and so on.
[*] Added a Rectangle tool for Map Tasks.
[*] Themes are now global instead of per-Project.
[*] Qutting MasterPlan by pressing the window's [X] now prompts for a quit.
[*] MasterPlan now always confirms when quitting, not just when the current project has been modified.
[*] Added a keyboard shortcut to quit MasterPlan (Ctrl+Q, by default).
[*] Added an optional border around the window (specifically for borderless mode if you want a bit more flavor).
[*] Added shadows for UI elements.
[*] Map Task type background has been slightly improved, is now a bit transparent.
[*] Various minor visual tweaks and smaller bug-fixes.
[*] Added shortcuts to teleport the camera to each end of a line, in sequence.
[*] The splash screen no longer takes nearly as long as it previously did to disappear. (~2.5 seconds -> ~0.75 seconds)
[*] Adding shortcuts for incrementing and decrementing Progression Tasks.
[*] Triggering Checkbox Tasks that have SubTasks will now trigger those SubTasks.
[*] Timers no longer pause when adjusting their values.
[*] Count-down timers can't be started if their value is 0.
[*] The grid dot background is now slightly transparent.
[*] Added rebindable shortcuts for previously hardcoded window-related functions (window size setting, fullscreen, showing FPS, taking a screenshot).
[*] Added rebindable Shortcuts for creating specific Task types.
[*] The "first / main" editable element in the Task Edit Panel for each Task type is now Focused by default.
[*] Project Volume spinner now goes from 0 to 100, rather than 0 to 10. The volume is also now more naturally distributed audibly.
[*] You can now hold Shift to select all Tasks between the currently selected one and the top or bottom of the stack with the corresponding shortcuts.
[*] Messages that display at the top-left last for a much shorter period of time (7 > 3 seconds).
[*] Timer triggering defaults to off now.
[*] Images now load in at their original aspect ratio, but the size depends on the zoom level. This means that images and GIFs should generally always be wholly visible onscreen when loaded.
[*] The option to reset images now is in the Task Edit panel.
[*] Errors in the message log at the top-left now show up as red.
[*] When Project resource auto-reloading is on, MasterPlan will now reload a file if the size OR modified time differs from what is cached in the project. (Previously, this was just based on the file being modified after the time when the resource was loaded.)
[*] Fixed up image and sound auto-reloading. It's no longer experimental, though it's still defaulted to being off.
[*] Sound Tasks now show the length of the sound and the current position of the playhead.
[*] Subtask bracketing tweaked to use different colors and is now slightly thicker.
[*] Adding some basic logging to the project loading process to help diagnose any issues with it.
[*] Map icon changed from a map to a thumbtack pin.
[*] Cloudy theme outline darkened to increase readability.
[*] Removing option to save sounds playing in the project settings; feels like a setting there wasn't really a use case for.
[*] FIX: Drawing on Whiteboards is no longer chunkier than intended (the resolution has been increased).
[*] FIX?: Incrementing a Progression Task's current value no longer increases the maximum if they're the same.
[*] FIX: It's no longer possible to undo a project that has just been loaded.
[*] FIX: Textboxes now don't take key input immediately after they're visible. This means you can now assign individual keys to shortcuts effectively (i.e. I to create an Image Task, and not type I immediately when the Task Edit dialog appears).
[*] FIX: Task swapping now is undo-able properly.
[*] FIX: Adding a new task or deleting Tasks now properly moves the entire stack below it. This works if Tasks are selected across multiple stacks.
[*] FIX: You can no longer paste characters into Textboxes that don't allow those characters.
[*] FIX: GIF Animation has been reviewed and fixed up. Animation frames should now be displayed more accurately (though not perfect in all cases, yet). The timing has also been tweaked to properly display GIFs that lack timing information and rely on default timings.
[*] FIX: Newlines are no longer sometimes overwritten in Textboxes.
[*] FIX: Slight basic improvements with regards to textbox usability.
[*] FIX: Whether timers are playing is now properly saved in the project plan.
[*] OPTIMIZATION: General rendering of Tasks.
[*] OPTIMIZATION: Cut down VRAM usage for Task editing considerably. This number can account for roughly 80% of the VRAM used for Tasks. (In testing, a plan that previously had 284 Tasks, most of which were Checkbox Tasks, used 1084mb of VRAM. Now it uses 204mb).
[*] OPTIMIZATION: Text rendering for Notes is now rendered to a texture, which is then rendered to the screen. This increases VRAM usage for Notes specifically, but is faster than rendering text directly to the screen. Work still remains to be done in this area, as there are still VRAM leaks in this regard.

-------

v0.6.1-3

-------

Updating manual.
Note icon is slightly more readable. Clock icon is less flat.
Pattern changes to be more readable.
Adding small icons for example usage in tutorial.
Fixing note and outline color being the same for Event Horizon theme.
MasterPlan now opens the tutorial on first launch (whenever the program settings doesn't exist, which should be sensible).
Set unfocused FPS to 60 by default (again).
FIX: Spinner expanding up kicks panel down. This should also fix the Spinner expanding the panel by too much, and regardless of if it's necessary (because the panel is already expanded enough).
Task selection improvements - selecting Tasks that are in a strict direction from another Task now works much more reliably, at the cost of being less "fuzzy" (so you can't select a Task that is slightly below and to the right of another Task using the right arrow key anymore, for example). 
To remedy this, I am also adding shortcuts to select nearby Tasks. These shortcuts should fairly reliably allow for selecting Tasks nearby the currently selected one, moving in a roughly cyclical manner (from top to bottom, and from left to right).
FIX: Home and End behavior changed for Textboxes. Home and End now jump to start and end of current line, rather than start or end of the entire Textbox, as per standard text editor behavior.

-------

v0.6.1-2

-------

Removing itch / Steam forums options.
Removing Steam purchase option from demo (as the demo's only on itch for now, so it doesn't make much sense to add a Steam purchase option).
FIX: Textboxes were previously shared between copied Tasks.

-------

v0.6.1-1

-------

FIX: MasterPlan crashing on start when creating a brand new project.

-------

v0.6.1

-------

Progression Tasks now have buttons to increment and decrement the values (when selected).
Broken sound icon updated for enhanced readability.
Tasks no longer glow so heavily, as that was making certain themes visually difficult to parse.
The theme Cloudy's colors have been tweaked. It is now lower contrast and more blue-tinted, overall.
Adding Waves, yet another dark theme.
Slightly tweaking checkbox and parent checkbox GUI icons to be more readable at a glance.
Adding loading plans from arguments back in. This was previously merged in a PR by @DanielKilgallon on 8/27 (#27), but apparently it got unmerged at some point. I'm re-adding it manually here.
Textboxes have been generally and drastically refactored to handle text more reliably and be more optimized in rendering and typing / usage. (Note that there is currently a GPU VRAM-related memory leak with textboxes as they expand, so be mindful of this.)
Blinking caret is now visible for 75% of the time, and blinks twice as often (every half-second), rather than 50% of the time, blinking every second.
Skipping words and lines with holding Control + arrow keys is now more exact, skipping to the boundaries of words rather than including spaces and necessitating more key presses to skip past those spaces. New lines are still "individualized" (so pressing Control+up skips to the end of the last word on the previous line still, for example).
Optimizing Textbox rendering code.
Moving between lines in Textbox has been tweaked to be simpler and easier to maintain on my side.
Consolidating options into rows for Project settings / tweaking wording.
Adding option to pan to mouse pointer when zooming in.
Adding button to default keyboard shortcuts.
Left click now cancels keyboard shortcut assignment, freeing up Escape as a key to use for assigning shortcuts.
Adding two more outer zoom levels.
Textboxes now can contain more text than just what fits within the box by using render textures.
By default, Textboxes now are centered vertically and expand vertically, but not horizontally.
GUIElement now has both Update() and Draw() because rendering textbox text to a texture can't be done in the draw loop where the Panel that contains it is transforming the elements to draw onto its texture.
Adding button to reset font settings back to default.
Adding option to turn off camera pan smoothing.
Adding options to change MasterPlan's font and font size.
Removing GUI font, as it's the same as the normal font, just displaying larger.
Fonts are now internally loaded at size 30, and then scaled up or down as desired.
Scroll wheel sensitivity raised, maximum is 10.
Scrolling panels with mouse wheel is smooth now.
Changing Task Type from a drop-down menu to a ButtonGroup for easier selection.
Changing how scroll wheel works for scrollbars in Panels - previously, it would scroll by a percentage. Now it scrolls by a set "chunk" size (so smaller lists are scrolled just as easily as larger ones).
Adding scroll wheel sensitivity to program settings.
Adding a setting for UnfocusedFPS. This allows you to set the target FPS when the window is minimized, hidden, or unfocused. It defaults to 60 FPS and the lowest value is 1.
Adding graphical options in settings.
    - Adding option for Graphical Tasks (like images, whiteboards, or maps) can now be transparent when changing global Task transparency.
    - Adding option for deadline animation, so that it can be as understated or distracting as desired.
Clicking on Tasks no longer visually raises them.
Logging improvements. Errors should now be logged onscreen. (This could be due to things like not having a valid clipboard tool installed on Linux, for example.)
MasterPlan now stores its settings and log file in the XDG-standard local user configuration directory. For Linux, this should be ~/.config/MasterPlan, for Mac OS, ~/Library/Preferences/MasterPlan, and for Windows, C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Local\MasterPlan.
Logging improvements. MasterPlan now prints when it is initialized and exited properly - just this can help to ensure that the log is set up properly and writing. Logging is also cleaned up / less cluttered in case of a crash.
Whiteboards can now be inverted.
Sliding Tasks should now be a bit more optimized and less CPU-intensive.
Notes and other Task types can now extend a list of numberable Tasks.
Overall optimizations for textboxes and placing Tasks.
FIX: Progression Tasks no longer list subtasks; now only Checkbox Tasks properly "list" sub-tasks.
FIX: Textboxes now allow dragging above the textbox to select text at the beginning.
FIX: Panels can be dragged offscreen when holding the mouse button down.
FIX: Board.PasteContent() no longer prints an error if the item could not be loaded, as that is an acceptable outcome.
FIX: Textboxes not updating after resetting them.
FIX: Canceling screenshot directory or custom font path setting should not set it to "" (a blank string).
FIX: Resizing a Task individually previously didn't trigger the undo system; now this is fixed.
FIX: Undo no longer "un-destroys" Tasks when undoing all the way to the beginning of the .
FIX: MasterPlan no longer crashes when attempting to remove deleted previously opened plans.
FIX: Numberable Tasks now take priority in lists. Previously, either numberable Tasks or other Tasks (like Notes) would take priority, meaning Notes would make Task lists number inconsistently.
FIX: WM_CLASS on Linux no longer has the version number. This is achieved by simplifying the window title on creation. It is simply the program name at the beginning.
FIX: ProgramSetttings are no longer reset on program start. This was because the Project.ProjectSettingsOpen variable is set to true in case of showing the About Dialog, but then the global settings (like, say, the TargetFPS) isn't set to point to the global ProgramSettings values (this only was done correctly if manually opening the Settings dialog from the right-click menu).
FIX: Crash when changing themes on tutorial. This was due to the color switching process for Whiteboards.
FIX: Sliding Tasks now works properly for "larger" Tasks that take up more space than a single row (images, Notes). Sliding Tasks in a direction occupied by an existing Task will attempt to have the Tasks swap positions (if the spaces are free).
FIX: Adding a duration for repeating keybindings. This also fixes keybindings repeating faster at higher FPS values.
FIX: Editing shortcuts (backspace, delete, etc) no longer repeat faster depending on FPS when editing text.
FIX: Whiteboards weren't the correct colors on load because the MessageThemeChange message wasn't sent when setting the theme through the ChangeTheme() function.
FIX: Can't use the left Super / Apple key on Mac.

-------

v0.6.0

-------

Adding keybindings. Keys can now be rebound from the settings screen.
Adding Whiteboard Task Type. Whiteboards serve to allow for drawing images in your plan. Note that the drawings can balloon the size of the plan dramatically, so it's best used sparingly or for simple drawings / idea sketches.
Adding the project file name to the window title.
MapImages can now be cleared through GUI.
MapImage now only shows its editing button when selected.
Rewriting Image / Map / Whiteboard resizing code.
Selected Tasks raise them up to visually be "on top".
Updating help manual.

FIX: Held keybinding triggers more reliably.
FIX: MapImage no longer stays in edit mode when resizing.
FIX: Errant / non-existant entries in recent plan list are removed when opening context menu.
FIX: The Project Setting Auto Reload Resources is now unchecked by default.
FIX: Default zoom level is now correctly set to 100%.
FIX: Can't click on the edit button for Maps or Whiteboards and quickly start drawing.
FIX: Undoing is now more consistent internally.
FIX: Tasks now stay selected when undoing or redoing.
FIX: Panels can no longer close if a GUI element is "open" or "activated".
FIX: Panel spacing fixes.
FIX: You no longer have to hold Shift and Alt to deselect Tasks, but rather just Alt.
FIX: Switching to Boards using a key binding now announces this via the Log.
FIX: Line Tasks no longer point to their base, but rather a different neighboring Task.
FIX: Program timing fixes.
FIX: Images are no longer always at least slightly transparent.
FIX: Some GIFs were previously displaying incorrectly.
FIX: Can't display resources that are linked to by URLs.
FIX: Can't use partial URLs for resources. (This allows for usage of "abc.com/image.png" instead of "https://abc.com/image.png", as an example.)

-------

v0.5.4-1

-------

MasterPlan now saves window position on exit (by default).
Screenshot save directory can now be customized on a per-project basis (thanks to Oscar over on GitHub!​).
MasterPlan now alerts you to where a screenshot is saved.
Cleaned up splashscreen.
FIX: Demo was disallowing saving improperly.

-------

v0.5.4

-------

Adding a demo. The demo mode is the same as the paid version, just with the inability to save projects and a different "About" section in the settings.
Improving general autosave reliability.
Windows executable now has proper MasterPlan icon and properties.
Dropping a text file onto MasterPlan will now create a Note of its contents.
FIX: Image size being reset on project save / load.
FIX: Task.LoadResource() shouldn't attempt to use an Audio Resource that didn't load properly. This fixes a crash where you can attempt to play a sound that didn't load.
FIX: Add logging messages for when you drop an image, sound, or text file onto MasterPlan successfully.
FIX: Dropping a local sound file onto MasterPlan no longer renames it if it has an incorrect extension name.

-------

v0.5.3

-------

- Timing improvements. Previously, MasterPlan was timed using Vsync; this is now replaced with my own timing system using time.sleep(), which should be more cross-platform friendly and make the main goroutine pause without consuming CPU execution. Otherwise, higher refresh rates would cause faster execution speeds (making things like double-clicking or moving using WASD quasi-impossible) or making the CPU idle at high cost as raylib currently seems to internally use a busy-wait-while loop by default on Mac and Linux. This timing mechanism isn't perfect, but is relatively easy to implement and seems accurate enough.
- Adding experimental option to automatically reload media. This is experimental because it seems like it might be possible to mangle media if MP detects and goes to load a file before the OS is finished writing it. I believe I've mitigated this, but it's still experimental until more people test it out. It also does this every frame for every Task, so it's also a bit slow for the moment.
- Adding transparent and borderless window. Props to pureref.com for the idea!
- Adding quit option to context menu; the context menu is now slightly thinner and no longer has spacers to account for this.
- Adding Target FPS option to global program settings.
- FIX: Previously was unable to "refresh" a Task that used media; whatever was loaded was stuck like that until you reloaded the project or MasterPlan. Now when prompted to load media (e.g. after closing the Task), MasterPlan will check to see if the media on disk is newer than the media already loaded; if so, it will reload it.

-------

v0.5.2-1

-------

- FIX: JPG images aren't loading.

-------

v0.5.2

-------

- FIX: Paths are serialized relative to the project root.
- FIX: Images weren't loading with proper size.
- Lines now have outlines.
- Line Tasks no longer draw inside of squares.
- Map background colors are darker for light themes and lighter for dark themes.
- Remove FPS cap. Instead, MasterPlan will be tied to Vsync for timing; this seems to keep the CPU from using busy wait loop idling (see raylib's issue #217), lowering CPU requirements.
- Allowing panning with the middle mouse button while editing Tasks or Project settings.
- Minor graphical fixes and changes.
- Pressing a Spinner to expand its menu will now display all options in the list.
- EventHorizon theme's colors tweaked to be more readable.
- FIX: Tasks and their copies were linked unintentionally (where changing the deadline or completion status on one would influence the other).
- The view no longer focuses on pasted Tasks.
- Lines are drawn on top of Tasks now.
- Bullet numbering sequences use a proper icon rather than the letter "o".
- Adding Square and Star numbering sequences.
- Rearranging GUI elements for editing Tasks and Project settings.
- Maps are now always behind other Tasks.
- Panel shadows have been added, and are now colored according to the theme.
- Adding smoother zoom steps to mouse wheel.
- Making zoom reach further on keyboard.
- The Task selection square changes color to increase visibility.
- FIX: Can't open project settings after opening a Spinner and closing with Escape.
- Adding option to turn off glowing for incomplete, complete, and selected Tasks.
- FIX: Flat shadows darken Maps' backgrounds.
- Adding SoundVolume project property to control how loudly sounds play through MasterPlan.
- Theme colors tweaked for Dark Crimson, Moonlight, and ZERO.
- URLs entered in Tasks (e.g. "google.com") now become buttons that take you to the site when clicked. URL Buttons are displayed when holding the Ctrl key, or are always displayed if the new project settings option is enabled. They display on Note, Progression, and Checkbox Tasks.
- Settings panel fleshed out to be separated into categories using a button group.
    - FIX: It was previously possible to double-click outside of a Task Edit panel or the Project Settings panel and immediately create and edit a Task. This has been fixed.​
- FIX: Panels weren't properly sized, and would require scrollbars even when all of their elements were properly being displayed.
- FIX: Spinners' menus expanding should expand the Panel, creating a scrollbar if necessary.
- FIX: Can no longer paste Line Endings to a different Board than their base.
- FIX: Copying Lines works more reliably now.
- FIX: Copying Lines no longer moves the ending down a cell.
- FIX: You can now properly undo line movement and creation if two Line Tasks end on the same point.
- FIX: Line endings that were on the same location no longer rotate when being dragged.
- Adding About page to settings with buttons leading to community / social media pages.
- Removing version name from top-right.
- Renaming "Help" option "Open Tutorial" and moving it lower in the context menu.

-------

v0.5.1

-------

- Project lock is now undone when the corresponding setting is unchecked in project settings, not just when the settings panel is actually closed.
- Adding a grid and a placement indicator to editing MapImages.
- FIX: Shifting new Map Task crashed MP.
- FIX: There was a slight lag between panning camera and task position updating (this could have caused a bit of a motion sickness inducing effect when panning previously).
- FIX: Backups weren't being made on Windows.
- FIX: Loading resources had the working directory as root for determining the path to the resources, not the project's filepath.
- FIX: Images weren't loading with proper size.

-------

v0.5.0

-------

- Adding Map Task. Map Tasks allow you to draw a shape (like a room layout, or basic map for a town / continent) for your projects.
- Adding global Task Transparency to project settings.

-------

v0.4.0

-------

- Updating splashscreen.
- Adding undo / redo. FINALLY. Note that Tasks no longer are deleted like before; - this is done because they could be restored. HOPEFULLY THIS DOESN'T COME BACK TO BITE ME.
- Fix: Cloned Tasks have unique IDs.
- Fix: Right clicking when project settings is open closes the menu.
- Fix: NumberSpinner is positioned properly (or just more correctly) in settings menu.
- Serialization (saving and loading) of Tasks / Projects improved.
- FIX: Project SampleRate isn't loaded properly. 
- Redirecting log output of MasterPlan to a file ("log.txt", in the same folder as MasterPlan) so that errors and crashes can be sent to me by reference. 
- Adding automatic backups. Automatic backups happen every X minutes, configurable by the user. MP will automatically delete the oldest backups that exceed the maximum count.
- FIX: Progression completion current and max can no longer go below 0.
- MasterPlan no longer asks for project directory on save. Now it asks for the project file name itself, sensibly.
- FIX: If the last loaded project doesn't exist, MP no longer crashes.
- FIX: Messages logged are clearer and easier to read with indentations and dashes ("-").
- FIX: Errors for failures when loading projects are no longer displayed (and logged) twice.
- FIX: Message logging now works correctly with multiple lines per message (\n).
- FIX: Deadlines can no longer show up on un-completable Tasks by setting the deadline on a un-completable​ Task, and then changing its type.

-------

v0.3.1

-------

- Fix: Can't load projects (whoops, this was a major, but extremely simple, bug).

-------

v0.3.0

-------

- Adding a Line Task type. Lines have arrow heads that can be positioned as desired. To make more lines from the same start point, simply copy and paste the line ending.
- Adding help entry to right-click menu. This loads a tutorial plan to walk through to help learn the program.
- Adding ability to rearrange the order of Boards by means of the buttons next to the active Board name.
- Reworked how Tasks are stored internally, which should HOPEFULLY improve efficiency.
- Default theme for new projects is now always Sunlight.
- MasterPlan title bar now adds a * when the project has been modified.
- Autosaving is now indicated at top-right of MasterPlan.
- MasterPlan now asks for confirmation when destructively changing the current project (save as, new project, load project).
- Tasks that are copy-pasted are now directly placed where the mouse points, like cutting.
- Parent Tasks now only count their direct Sub-tasks' completion statuses for completion, not all leaves.
- Sub-tasks can now be visually bracketed into their parent Task. This option enhances readability at a glance.
- Adding ability to move all Tasks in all directions (not just numberable Tasks, and not just up and down) by means of holding Control.
- Board switching shortcuts are now Shift+numbers. More comfortable, sensible defaults.
- Adding ability to select Tasks in direction from selected Task using arrow keys.​
- Renaming Project Settings > Settings in context menu.
- Fix: Repositioning the "<" button for find + replace.
- Fix: Can't close Tasks when editing them (was sending wrong message on "X" button press).
- Fix: Tasks not being numbered properly, after closing a Task.
- Fix: Cam center no longer depends on window size.
- Fix: Copying and cutting pastes tasks so the center of all pasted Tasks hits where the mouse cursor is.
- Fix: Updating excel.ttf to fix ; and : characters being too low. Adding & character as well.
- Fix: Tasks not being selected on load when they were on save.
- Fix: \n runes can be highlighted in Textbox.
- Fix: Can't search for timers by their name.
- Fix (?): Searchbar now expands as you type.
- Fix: Project settings options are now more properly spaced.
- Adding ability to lock Projects. This disables saving after saving once after the option has been enabled. Useful for locking projects in a specific state to ensure they aren't accidentally modified.
- Fix: Closing task edit window doesn't flip Project.Modified tag / create the opportunity for auto-saving - this was because I was calling task.ReceiveMessage instead of project.SendMessage (which is what ESC was doing on project, so it shouldn't be a huge deal to migrate it to task.go).
- Fix: Switching between projects should be more efficient now, as resources are now freed from the previous project.
- Fix: Temporary files created during resource download process weren't being deleted properly.
- Fix: Pan now defaults to 0,0 for new Projects.
- Fix: Autosaving now works on fewer actions (just adding tasks, editing tasks, moving tasks, deleting tasks, and changing the project settings). This makes it less of a chore to work with. 
- Fix: Autosave no longer triggers during load (this was wholly unnecessary). 
- Fix: Description now has focus on when going to edit a Task.
- MasterPlan now has an icon and is more "app-like" on Mac.

-------

v0.2.3

-------

You can now disable the splashscreen on startup.
You can now rename Boards. Adding a button for this, the Rename button, to the right of the currently active Board.
Adding Cloudy theme.
MasterPlan's text rendering is now Unicode character compliant (this means that common Latin characters for non-English languages like À or Æ can be typed and display correctly). 
Note that I'm designing the characters myself, so not every character for every Latin-based language is implemented currently. Let me know on the forums if a language is missing
characters: https://itch.io/board/555951/general
Switching out the font from Monaco to my own, Excel.
FIX: Can't release mouse over status bar.
FIX: Selection rectangle offset over the individual characters when selecting text in Textbox.
FIX: Text selection and highlighting improved, fixed for center-aligned text.
FIX: Task and its clone share deadline properties.
FIX: Can't choose image files to load on Mac.

-------

v0.2.2

-------

Adding option to disable Task Outlines.
Images now lock to a grid when scaling - to disable this, hold shift while dragging their size.
Adding an "Open Recent" menu to the right-click context menu.
Making Open Recent menu have an option stating no recent plans have been opened if that's the case, rather than being blank.
MP can now take screenshots without the GUI using the F11 shortcut or the Screenshot context menu option.
Projects now save which Board is active.
Adding 3D shadow type.
Lengthening smooth shadow slightly.
Filtering images using anisotropic filtering for clearer zooming.
Program settings file is now called "masterplan-settings.json".
Updating a few themes to update shadow color.
Fix: Can't select the task below the top-most Task on the Board using the keyboard.
Fix: Settings is always saved next to the MasterPlan executable.
Fix: Autoloading last plan wasn't being loaded properly.
Fix: Numbering sequence was broken across all Boards except the first one. 
Fix: Auto-load checkbox not properly loaded on running MasterPlan.
Fix: All Tasks update now. Before it was just the ones on the current Board. This fixes timers and sounds not playing when switching Boards.
Fix: Stopping all playing sounds works across all Boards.
Fix: Searching for a Task switches to the Board it resides on.
Fix: Boards are now numbered starting from 1, rather than 0.

-------

v0.2.1

-------

Added Boards. A Board represents a collection of Tasks. Boards are selected by utilizing the Board selection menu at the top-right (or an 
    associated shortcut, which is Ctrl + 1, 2, 3..., 0). You can add Boards by clicking on the + button in that same menu. Empty Boards (Boards
    that don't contain any Tasks) are deleted if they are not open.
Added the Board number on the grid background at origin (0, 0).
Added Cut Tasks option and shortcut. Pasting cut Tasks move them to the mouse's position.
Fixed wording of Log messages that mention "Tasks" to mention "Task(s)" instead (to cover singular Task use cases).

You can now configure the sound playback sample rate in the Project Settings.
Sample rate is now set to 22050 by default (the only sample rate that seems to play sounds back flawlessly in my tests, oddly) on Mac.
Fix: Unable to load .plan files on Mac because the most recent Mac OS version seems to have trouble recognizing file extensions in some cases. So 
    instead, I'm just removing the filter on the File Open dialog for now.
Fix: On Mac, shortcuts can now use Super instead of Control. Note that I'm still allowing people to use Control for those shortcuts as well if they 
    prefer.
Loading saved plans are validated a little bit more - if the file loaded isn't valid JSON or does not have a "Tasks" entry, then the load will fail 
    gracefully.
Fix: New Tasks now are created beneath the top-most selected Task, regardless of numbering sequence.
Pasting Tasks now pastes them below the last Task selected, in the same column.
Fix: Dragging image or sound files over MasterPlan create associated Tasks, but don't automatically load the media.

_______

v0.2.0
_______

Fix: Splashscreen not displaying on Mac build.
Splash screen now displays for 1.5 seconds minimum.
Hopeful Fix: Set application build type to GUI on Windows, making it so the command prompt doesn't appear when running.
FIX: Task bar not filling for Timer when running.
Adding splash screen.
FIX: Task completion time constantly set on save for parent Tasks with completed subtasks.
Adding Timer Task type. The Timer allows people to add Timers to their plan, allowing them to better control how and when they work. It allows for 
    Pomodoro-style timing-based workflows (work for x minutes, rest for y minutes, repeat) into their daily development. Timers that are next to 
    each other trigger in sequence, much like Sound Tasks.
Sound Tasks now have buttons for playing, pausing, and restarting sounds.
Completing Tasks with [C] now is displayed as a notification.
Deadline patterns cycle faster to indicate urgency.
Changed deadline icons and patterns a bit.

FIX: Couldn't type caps in textbox after Ctrl+A to select all text.
FIX: Couldn't hold shift and click to select text.
Saving version number in .plan save file. This is to allow backwards compatibility being built in with previous saves in case features are added, changed, or removed.
FIX: Crash if starting MasterPlan and Autoload Last Project setting didn't save.

Major changes - Resource management improvements.
Resources (images and GIFs) are now stored in a central location on the Project and are reused between Tasks.
Resource downloading and loading has been improved by the addition of the usage of a MIME type detection library. This allows for MasterPlan to see 
    what kind of file a file is after downloading, even if the file doesn't have the correct filepath. This means that Paste Content now works much 
    more reliably across media found on the Internet.
Lengthening the amount of time messages are on screen (5 seconds to 7 seconds).
Escape key now defocuses textboxes.
Enter key now is also a shortcut to jump to the next Task in a search when the searchbar is highlighted (like Ctrl+F). Shift+Enter goes back (much like Shift+Ctrl+F).
Adding project setting to save sounds that are currently playing.

FIX: Percentage didn't fill a Task if under 1% filled. That value has now been bumped to 0.01%.
FIX: Log reporting selection and deselection of Tasks was incorrect.
FIX: Pasting Tasks now lowers them below the column of existing Tasks (if the Task is completable). A TODO is to make all Tasks able to have 
    neighbors so you can shift them around easily using the keyboard.
FIX: Crash if using Ctrl+V to paste Tasks with no Tasks copied.
FIX: Crash if playing resampled audio and looping it multiple times (4-6 in my tests on a specific file). This seems to be FIXed by lowering the 
    quality of resampling (quality of 4 > quality of 1).
FIX: Hang when deleting Tasks due to Tasks registering their neighbors that include themselves, resulting in a loop (A.TaskAbove = B, B.TaskAbove = 
    A). This is resolved by comparing Task positions more absolutely to determine whether a Task is another's neighbor.

Massive textbox improvements.
You can now select blocks of text in textboxes, either by mouse click and drag, or by holding shift and using the keyboard.
Ctrl + A selects all Text.
You can now copy, paste, and cut text to/from the system clipboard in textboxes.
FIX: Navigating text lines by keyboard in textboxes is no longer as inaccurate. Clicking on lines is also vastly improved.

You can now move multiple Tasks at a time with the keyboard.
You can now select multiple Tasks using Shift + up or down arrow.
Ctrl + arrow keys now move Tasks, rather than Shift. This is a bit more awkward, but more consistent with how holding shift allows for selecting 
    multiple Tasks with the mouse.
Moving Tasks no longer adjusts the indentation. This seems better to keep Tasks arranged consistently and not jump around when moving groups of 
    Tasks around.
Escape now deselects all Tasks.
Page Up and Page Down now selects the first or last Task in a column, respectively.
FIX: Shadows no longer render on top of Tasks.
FIX: You can now pan while dragging Tasks.
FIX: Projects couldn't restore the pan of the camera from saved plans. To resolve this, creating new Tasks now no longer focuses the view on them.
HOPEFUL FIX: Zoom locks when close to targeted zoom. Seems like I was getting some artifacting at 1x zoom level, but I can't seem to reproduce it 
    reliably. This should help make sure the zoom never stays at fractional levels.

Other assorted code rearrangings and minor fixes.

_______

v0.1.2
_______

MasterPlan now maintains global program settings in an external file.
FIX: Crash due to color theme spinner pointing to a theme that no longer exists if a theme is deleted or renamed.
FIX: Minor shadow bug (shadow blitting should be down by a pixel to not have jank on outer vertical edge).
Shadows are now "brighter" / denser.
Color theme spinner is wider now.
Themes reload when opening project settings now.
Adding Shade Thrower 3099 cyberpunk theme.
Changing notification fading from linear to cubic interpolation, making it easier to read for longer before it disappears.
Adding an icon for broken sounds.
More notifications display for loading images and sounds.
FIX: #7 - Backspace teleports to origin for a frame before animating pan.
New Tasks are opened after creation.
Adding option for autoloading last saved project.
FIX: Context menu now never opens offscreen (#9).
FIX: Current value can't go above maximum for Progression Tasks. (#12)

Other assorted code rearrangings and minor fixes.
